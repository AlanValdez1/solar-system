			<h1>Inner Planets</h1>

			<p>The “Inners” refers to the 4 planets closest to the Sun, which also happen to be the 4 terrestrial planets closest to the sun. In order of closest to furthest from the Sun, they are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.</p>

			<section>
				<h2 id="mercury">Mercury</h2>
				<p>Slightly larger than Earth’s own moon, it is the smallest planet in our solar system and closest one to the Sun. Because it’s the closest to the Sun, it is the fastest planet to orbit around it (about 29mi/s or 47km/s) and has the shortest year which is 88 days. It seems to resemble more Earth’s moon as it is riddled with craters. On the topic of moons, Mercury has none. The atmosphere, or exosphere, seems to be pretty thin and has mainly oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K), which isn’t exactly an atmosphere we could breathe in.</p>

			<section>
				<h2 id="venus">Venus</h2>
				<p>Second planet from the Sun, Venus is actually the hottest planet in our solar system due to its thick atmosphere which traps heat and creates a runaway greenhouse effect. Temperatures on the surface are roughly 390°C (or 700°F), which is enough to melt lead, and is hotter than it would be without the greenhouse effect. Because of this effect, the atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). There are also thick clouds of sulfuric acid covering Venus. Another interesting thing is that it is often referred to as “Earth’s twin”, but only due to their similar size and structure. It is different to the other planets (with the exception of one other), however, because it rotates backwards on its axis, which means the Sun rises on the West and sets in the East instead. Due to this, a day on Venus (243 Earth days) is actually longer than a year on Venus (about 225 Earth days).</p>

			<section>
				<h2 id="earth">Earth</h2>
				<p>Our own home is the third plant from the Sun, teeming with an immense variety of lifeforms, and is the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on its surface. It is the biggest of the 4 terrestrial planets and 5th biggest of all the planets in this solar system. The atmosphere is made of 78% nitrogen (N), 21% oxygen (O) and 1% other things like carbon dioxide which is great for breathing. This atmosphere is also able to protect us from most of the harmful radiation from the Sun as well as from meteoroids which tend to burn up in it before they can even reach the surface. Earth is the only planet with a single moon in our solar system.</p>

			<section class="last">
				<h2 id="mars">Mars</h2>
				<p>Fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is known as the “Red planet” due to the oxidized iron minerals on its soil which causes the planet’s red colour. Mars is smaller than Earth but has 2 moons. A day on Mars is just over 24 hours on Earth (about 24.6hrs) while a year is 687 Earth days. The thin atmosphere of Mars is not breathable as it is made up of mostly carbon dioxide (CO2), argon (Ar), nitrogen (N2) and a bit of oxygen (O) and water vapor. There are indications that the landscape of Mars has changed over the years due to things like volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement and even atmospheric conditions like dust storms. One of its greatest features, a large canyon system called Valles Marineris, is about the same length as the distance from California to New York, more than 4,800km (or 3,000mi).</p>
